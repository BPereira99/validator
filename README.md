# ESVA MODULE

## Summary
This document describes the deployment of the ESVA Module and its endpoints. 

## Deployment
Each partner is responsible for its own instalation of this module in their own machines. To install the module, 4 steps are required for the reader to make:

### 1. Create the Home Folder
In your machine, create a home directory for the module in your `/data` folder called "esva".
E.g.: `mkdir /data/esva`

### 2. Place the needed certificates
You will need to have the SSL certificates for NGINX, generated by you.

You will need to create the directory `/data/esva/ssl_certs`, which will contain these files. 
The certificate file must be named as "fullchain.pem" and the key must be named "privkey.pem"

### 3. Clone the Repository and fill in the Environment Variables
You should clone the repository in the `/data/esva` directory and check the ".env.example" file (example below) inside the repository and follow its guidelines, adjusting the variables to your specific needs. For that, create a .env file in the `/data/esva` folder and fill it in with the variables adjusted to you.

### 4. Run the installation script
Finally, in order to set up the containers and run the program, run the command `git checkout partner-deployment` (if you are already on this branch, you can skip this command). Inside this branch, you will find scripts to activate the containers. There is a script in case you are handling a staging machine and a script if you are handling a production machine.
After you run the script, the containers will be up and you will be able to use ESVA module.
